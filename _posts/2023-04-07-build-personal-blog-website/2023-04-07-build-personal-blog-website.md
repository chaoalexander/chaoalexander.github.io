A long time ago, I wanted to establish my own blog website to encourage myself to learn and share, but purchasing domain servers, public IP addresses, and so on made me hesitate. Fortunately, I found that it wasn't really difficult. I spent some time building this website, using [Github Page][github page] and [Jekyll][jekyll]. It was so convenient and useful that I couldn't wait to share it. You can follow my steps to establish your own personal blog, The style of my blog website is based on [Lil'blog][lil'log], and I really like its simplicity.You can search for your favorite personal blogger websites online, or simply use themes recommended by Jekyll
